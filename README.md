# acidoCEST_Machine_Learning


### Next
- Do we need the data at (power=  0.5 and 1.0 uT, sat time = 0.50 or 1.0 seconds) (heat map of error 2d)
- How much does measuring other things beside the Z spectra help?
- Are the regression outlier due to Power and T1
- Effect of noise

- Do these later
2. Can we start with fewer frequencies ?
3. What frequencies are needed ?
5. Max 27 or 25 frequencies
6. pH higher than 6.8
